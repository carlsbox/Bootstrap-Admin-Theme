OpenHIM Web-UI Admin Theme 
==========================

A test bed for exploring a new interface and design for the HIM Web UI that will address some of the administrative needs of the tool.

Some key features that this interface will need to address:
- List and Display active 'channels' on the HIM
- List and administer all 'system' users of the HIM (i.e. applications that have access to the HIM channels)
- List and display the 'monitoring aspects' of the HIM:
-- Number of messages per channel etc

The interface is forked from a generic admin theme built with Bootstrap free for both personal and commercial use. 

This is still a work in progress and will begin to focus itself on a Web ADMIN UI for the OpenHIM.
